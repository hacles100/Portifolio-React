        "Nothing in this world beats good old persistence. Talent does not
        overcome. Nothing more common than failed talents. Genius can't be
        beaten. Unrecognized genius is practically a clich√©. Education does not
        overcome. Because the world is full of educated fools. Persistence and
        determination, alone, are powerful."
